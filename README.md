Hello, I'm a graduate student studying under Professor [Quinn Thomas](https://www.epics.frec.vt.edu/?page_id=67) in the [Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation](http://frec.vt.edu) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu).

**The earth's forests are central to its climate.** In my research I use Earth System Models, _computer models that simulate the planet_, to explore the role that human managment of forests plays in influencing our climate.  How are the forest [ecosystem services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_service) we depend on going to be affected by climate change? Can we manage forests in a way that will help mitigate climate change? These are the types of questions I seek to answer.

I perform experiments using the Community Land Model, an instantiation of the [Community Terrestrial Systems Model](http://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM), and [FATES](http://github.com/NGEET/fates) as part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM).

**My current projects in the FATES model include:**
* Developing a loblolly pine plant functional type.
* Incorporating forest managment activities with the [Vegetation Managment Module](https://joshuarady.github.io/VegetationManagement/).
