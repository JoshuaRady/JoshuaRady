Hello, I'm a postdoctoral researcher at [Woodwell Climate Research Center](https://www.woodwellclimate.org) as part of the [Permafrost Pathways](https://permafrost.woodwellclimate.org) team.
<!-- graduate student studying under Professor [Quinn Thomas](https://www.epics.frec.vt.edu/?page_id=67) in the [Department of Forest Resources and Environmental Conservation](http://frec.vt.edu) at [Virginia Tech](https://vt.edu).-->

**The Earth's forests and soils are central to its climate and important to human wellbeing.**  How will human driven climate change alter forest [ecosystem services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_service) and the carbon storage capacity of soils?  What must we do to reduce climate change impacts and help people to adapt to those that can't be avoided. Can we manage forests in a way that will help mitigate climate change? These are the types of questions I seek to answer.

I'm currently studying how climate driven changes in wildfire in the Arctic Boreal Zone will effect vegetation and the storage of carbon in [permafrost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permafrost) using the [DMV-DOS-TEM](https://github.com/uaf-arctic-eco-modeling/dvm-dos-tem) computer model.

In other work I have used Earth System Models, _computer models that simulate the planet_, to explore the role that human managment of forests plays in influencing our climate.  I perform experiments using the Community Land Model, an instantiation of the [Community Terrestrial Systems Model](http://github.com/ESCOMP/CTSM), and [FATES](http://github.com/NGEET/fates) as part of the Community Earth System Model (CESM).

**My current projects in the FATES model include:**
* Developing a loblolly pine plant functional type.
* Incorporating forest managment activities with the [Vegetation Managment Module](https://joshuarady.github.io/VegetationManagement/).
